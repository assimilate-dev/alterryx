## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a link to the API documentation in the description field. Alteryx is
  licensed software and hosted by the purchaser of the license on their
  hardware. As such, there is no standard API URL because the domain will be
  the domain of the server hosting Gallery. However, the API documentation
  outlines each endpoint, it's function, and it's parameters.
  
* Updated the package DESCRIPTION field to better reflect the package
  requirements. Alteryx integrates with R and this package is intended to be
  used by those who have purchased a license.

* Added two relevant URLS to the URL field in DESCRIPTION

## Test Environments
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Michael Treadwell <michael.treadwell@interworks.com>'
  New submission
  
  This is, in fact, a new submission.

## Downstream dependencies
This package has no downstream dependencies.
